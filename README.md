# 🎥 Video Anonymization with EgoBlur

This repository provides a pipeline to anonymize video datasets by blurring sensitive content (e.g., license plates, faces) using the **EgoBlur** model.

## 🔎 What is This?
With increasing privacy concerns and legal restrictions on visual data, it's essential to anonymize personally identifiable information in videos. This project uses **EgoBlur**, a vision model for responsible anonymization, to automatically detect and blur such information in a scalable and smart way.

## 🤯 Key Features
- License plate detection and elliptical Gaussian blurring
- Object ID tracking across frames using annotations
- Adaptive multi-pass thresholding for robust detection
- Dynamic cropping thresholds to skip tiny irrelevant regions

## 🚀 Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/egoblur-anonymization
cd egoblur-anonymization
conda create -n ego_blur python=3.9
conda activate ego_blur
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure to place the model checkpoint `ego_blur_lp.jit` under `models/`.

## ⚖️ Pipeline Overview
![Flowchart](docs/Flowchart.jpg)


## 🔢 How It Works
1. **For each frame in the video**:
   - Get all bounding boxes and object IDs from the annotation file
   - Crop the bounding box region
   - If area is too small, skip
   - Try to blur it using EgoBlur (up to 5 attempts with decreasing threshold)
   - Replace in frame if blurred, otherwise log
2. Save updated frame
3. Export log as JSON summarizing blur status of each object across frames

## 💡 Tips
- You can tune `min_crop_area_ratio` and `nms_iou_threshold` for different datasets
- Blurring logic is separated in `ego_blur_utils_eliptical.py` and can be modified for different blur effects
